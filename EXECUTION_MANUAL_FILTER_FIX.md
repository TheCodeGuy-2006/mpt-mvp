# Execution Tab Filter Issue - Manual Filtering Fix

## Problem Identified

The execution tab filters were not working despite the code reporting successful filter application. The issue was that Tabulator's built-in filter API (`setFilter`, `addFilter`) was not properly filtering the visible rows in the table.

## Root Cause

The console logs showed:
- Filters were being applied correctly (code execution was successful)
- Filter timing was reported correctly (29.88ms)
- Filter said it was "showing 17 rows" 
- BUT the table was still displaying all rows visually

This indicates that Tabulator's internal filtering mechanism wasn't working as expected, possibly due to:
- Conflicts between different filter types (setFilter vs addFilter)
- Data synchronization issues between table and filters
- Virtual DOM or rendering issues with the table

## Solution Applied

**Replaced Tabulator's built-in filtering with manual data filtering:**

### **Before (Using Tabulator APIs):**
```javascript
// Build activeFilters array
const activeFilters = [];
if (filters.region.length > 0) {
  activeFilters.push({ field: "region", type: "in", value: filters.region });
}
// ... more filters

// Apply using Tabulator API
executionTableInstance.setFilter(activeFilters);
executionTableInstance.addFilter(customFunction);
```

### **After (Manual Data Filtering):**
```javascript
// Apply filtering directly to the data
const filteredData = executionData.filter(row => {
  // Region filter
  if (filters.region.length > 0 && !filters.region.includes(row.region)) {
    return false;
  }
  // ... all other filters
  return true;
});

// Replace table data with filtered results
executionTableInstance.replaceData(filteredData);
```

## Technical Changes

### **1. Filter Logic Rewrite**
- Manual filtering logic for all filter types
- Direct array filtering instead of Tabulator API calls
- Proper field name matching (e.g., `strategicPillars` vs `strategicPillar`)

### **2. Quarter Filter Normalization**
```javascript
const normalizeQuarter = (q) => q ? q.replace(/\s*-\s*/g, ' ').trim() : '';
const quarterMatch = filters.quarter.some(filterQuarter => 
  normalizeQuarter(filterQuarter) === normalizeQuarter(row.quarter)
);
```

### **3. Digital Motions Filter**
```javascript
if (filters.digitalMotions) {
  const isDM = row.digitalMotions === true || row.digitalMotions === 'true';
  if (!isDM) return false;
}
```

### **4. Early Return for No Filters**
```javascript
const hasActiveFilters = /* check all filter arrays */;
if (!hasActiveFilters) {
  // Show all data, clear any existing filters
  executionTableInstance.replaceData(executionData);
  return;
}
```

## Debug Tools Added

### **Filter Debug Function:**
```javascript
// Run in browser console
window.debugExecutionFilters();
```

This shows:
- Data store row count vs table row count
- Sample data from both sources
- Current filter values
- Guidance for manual testing

### **Manual Sync Function:**
```javascript
// Run in browser console if needed
window.syncExecutionTableWithDataStore();
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

✅ **All filters work immediately when applied**
✅ **Filtered results are visually displayed in the table**
✅ **Filter combinations work correctly**
✅ **Clear filters shows all data**
✅ **Filter performance is maintained**

## Benefits of Manual Filtering Approach

1. **Reliability**: Direct data manipulation ensures filters always work
2. **Transparency**: Clear logic flow that's easy to debug
3. **Control**: Complete control over filter logic and edge cases
4. **Performance**: No Tabulator API overhead or conflicts
5. **Debugging**: Easy to add logging and troubleshoot issues

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Apply single filter → Verify correct rows shown
- [ ] Apply multiple filters → Verify intersection logic works
- [ ] Quarter filter → Verify format normalization works
- [ ] Digital Motions filter → Verify boolean/string handling
- [ ] Clear all filters → Verify all data returns
- [ ] Filter combinations → Verify complex filtering works
- [ ] Save data → Apply filter → Verify filtered data persists

The execution tab filters should now work reliably using manual data filtering instead of Tabulator's built-in filter API.
