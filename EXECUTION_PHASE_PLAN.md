# Execution Tab Master Dataset Implementation Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ Current State Analysis

### Issues Identified:
1. **Save Function Issue**: `setupExecutionSave()` uses `table.getData()` (line 179 & 702) - same issue as planning tab
2. **Filter Dependencies**: Uses `executionDataCache` and `table.replaceData()` approach - vulnerable to filter issues
3. **Tab Sync Issues**: Data sync between planning and execution may be inconsistent after planning master dataset changes
4. **Data Integrity**: No master dataset architecture - relies on table display data

### Architecture Differences from Planning:
- **Data Source**: Execution data comes from planning data (they're the same dataset with different views)
- **Columns**: Focused on execution status, costs, actuals (read-only view, no delete functionality needed)
- **Sync Function**: `syncDigitalMotionsFromPlanning()` keeps data synchronized
- **Save Endpoint**: Uses same "planning" endpoint for persistence

## ðŸ“‹ 3-Phase Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Enhanced ExecutionDataStore** 
**Objective**: Create master dataset architecture for execution tab

**Tasks**:
1. Create `ExecutionDataStore` class similar to `PlanningDataStore`
2. Implement master dataset storage with `masterData[]`
3. Add change tracking with `changeLog[]` 
4. Create debug utilities via `executionDebug`
5. Initialize store on execution tab load
6. **Sync Integration**: Ensure ExecutionDataStore stays synchronized with PlanningDataStore
7. **Note**: No delete functionality needed - execution is read-only view with status updates

**Expected Outcome**: Execution tab has robust master dataset foundation

### **Phase 2: Updated Save Function + Cross-Tab Sync**
**Objective**: Fix save function and ensure robust sync between tabs

**Tasks**:
1. Update `setupExecutionSave()` to use `executionDataStore.getData()` instead of `table.getData()`
2. Add console logging to show master vs filtered data counts
3. Update duplicate save function (appears to be duplicated like planning)
4. Ensure KPI calculations work on complete dataset
5. **Critical**: Update `syncDigitalMotionsFromPlanning()` to work with master datasets
6. **Critical**: Ensure planning deletes are properly handled in execution sync
7. **Cross-Tab Sync**: Update planning data store when execution data is saved

**Expected Outcome**: Save processes complete execution dataset + seamless cross-tab sync

---

### **Phase 3: Testing & Cross-Tab Validation**
**Objective**: Comprehensive testing including cross-tab data integrity

**Tasks**:
1. Create execution-specific test suite
2. Test save functionality with filters applied
3. **Critical**: Test cross-tab synchronization scenarios:
   - Delete in planning â†’ verify execution sync handles it correctly
   - Save in execution â†’ verify planning consistency  
   - Filter in both tabs â†’ verify independent operation
   - Add/modify in one tab â†’ verify sync to other tab
4. Create combined test scenarios
5. Performance testing with large datasets

**Expected Outcome**: Bulletproof execution tab with seamless planning integration

## ðŸ”— Cross-Tab Synchronization Strategy

### Key Synchronization Points:
1. **Data Loading**: Both tabs load from same master dataset
2. **Save Operations**: Execution saves update planning master dataset
3. **Planning Deletes**: When planning rows are deleted, execution sync handles appropriately
4. **Filter Independence**: Each tab's filters are independent but operate on synchronized data
5. **Real-time Sync**: Changes in one tab are reflected in the other

### Sync Functions to Update:
- `syncDigitalMotionsFromPlanning()` â†’ work with master datasets
- Cross-tab save operations
- Data loading and initialization
- Filter management across tabs

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

### Execution Tab Requirements:
- âœ… Save complete dataset regardless of filters
- âœ… Master dataset architecture
- âœ… Debug utilities for development
- âœ… Proper handling of planning deletes (rows disappear from execution when deleted in planning)

### Cross-Tab Integration Requirements:
- âœ… Seamless data synchronization
- âœ… Independent filter operations
- âœ… Consistent behavior when planning rows are deleted
- âœ… Unified save operations
- âœ… No data loss or corruption

## ðŸš€ Implementation Notes

### Unique Considerations for Execution:
1. **Shared Data Source**: Execution is a view of planning data, not separate dataset
2. **Status Focus**: Execution focuses on delivery status, costs, actuals vs planning forecasts
3. **Read-Only Nature**: Execution is primarily for tracking and status updates, no row deletion needed
4. **Cross-Tab Dependencies**: Changes must be carefully synchronized
5. **Planning Delete Handling**: When rows are deleted in planning, they should disappear from execution view

### Technical Approach:
- Reuse patterns from planning implementation
- Adapt for execution-specific data structure
- Ensure robust cross-tab communication
- Maintain performance with shared dataset

This plan will result in a robust execution tab that mirrors the master dataset benefits achieved in planning while maintaining seamless integration between the two tabs. The execution tab will serve as a read-only view for tracking campaign execution status without the complexity of delete functionality.
