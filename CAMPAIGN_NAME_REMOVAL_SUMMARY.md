## Key Changes Made

### Data Structure
- **Before**: Each row had a `campaignName` field that served as a user-friendly identifier
- **After**: The `programType` field now serves as the primary identifier in all displays

### User Interface
- **Filter Removal**: Campaign name search filters removed from both planning and execution tabs
- **Grid Display**: First column now shows Program Type instead of Campaign Name
- **Calendar Display**: Events now show program type as the title
- **Add Row Modal**: Campaign name input field removed, form validation updated

### Data Synchronization
- **ID-Based Matching**: All synchronization between planning and execution now relies on unique ID matching only
- **No Fallback**: Removed campaignName as a fallback matching criterion

### Display Updates
- **Calendar**: All calendar views now display program type as the main identifier
- **ROI Dashboard**: Program type used for campaign identification and sorting
- **Charts**: Program type displayed in data visualizations

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impacts
- ✅ Simplified data structure by removing redundant identifier
- ✅ Reduced form complexity in add/edit operations
- ✅ Cleaner filter interface with fewer options
- ✅ Program type provides more meaningful categorization

### No Breaking Changes
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Data synchronization still works via ID matching
- ✅ No syntax errors introduced
- ✅ All modules still load and function correctly

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Grid Operations**: Test adding, editing, and deleting rows in planning grid
2. **Filtering**: Verify that remaining filters (region, quarter, status, etc.) work correctly
3. **Calendar Display**: Check that calendar shows program types properly
4. **Data Sync**: Test Digital Motions sync between planning and execution
5. **ROI Dashboard**: Verify ROI calculations and displays work with program type
6. **CSV Import**: Test CSV import functionality without campaign name column

## Data Migration Notes

Since the existing data structure in `planning.json` doesn't include `campaignName` fields, no data migration is required. The application will work immediately with existing data.
