# CSV Import Master Dataset Sync Fix

## Problem Identified
When importing CSV data using the smart mapping functionality, the imported campaigns were only being added to the table instance (`planningTableInstance`) but not to the master dataset (`planningDataStore`). This caused:

1. ✅ Campaigns visible in the table (39 visible rows)
2. ❌ Master dataset remained empty (0 rows) 
3. ❌ Save function failed with "no data to save" message

## Root Cause
In the CSV import function (`planning.js` around line 2980), the code was using:
```javascript
planningTableInstance.addData(batch);
```

But it was missing the crucial step of adding each imported row to the master dataset, which is required for the save functionality to work.

## Solution Applied
Modified the CSV import batch processing to:

1. **Add each row to master dataset first**: Added `planningDataStore.addRow(row)` for each imported row
2. **Added logging**: Added console logging to track master dataset additions
3. **Maintained performance**: Kept the batch processing approach for UI responsiveness

## Code Changes
In `planning.js`, the CSV import section now includes:

```javascript
// Add each row to master dataset first, then to table
batch.forEach(row => {
  if (planningDataStore && typeof planningDataStore.addRow === 'function') {
    planningDataStore.addRow(row);
    console.log(`CSV Import: Added row to master dataset: ${row.id}`);
  }
});
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. ✅ Import CSV data using smart mapping
2. ✅ Data appears in table (visible rows)
3. ✅ Data is synced to master dataset 
4. ✅ Save functionality works correctly
5. ✅ Console shows "CSV Import: Added row to master dataset" messages

## Testing
After applying this fix:
1. Import a CSV file with the smart mapping feature
2. Check console logs for "CSV Import: Added row to master dataset" messages
3. Click Save - should now work without "no data to save" error
4. Data should persist correctly

## Impact
This fix ensures data consistency between the table display layer and the underlying data storage layer, making the CSV import feature fully functional for saving imported data.
